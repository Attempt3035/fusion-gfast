## Quick Start ðŸš€

### Dependencies
All you need is a python version that has been built with tkinter.

If you're on mac and installed python with brew or pyenv, you will likely need to uninstall, then `brew install tcl-tk`, then reinstall python so it gets built with tkinter. You'll know whether or not tkinter is working when you try to run the script - it'll come up with an error if it's not.

### Running the Script
1. Execute the python script
2. Choose your file to speed up
3. The output file is in the same location, with the prefix `-gfast`
4. Use your own tools to run a diff check, simulate the gcode or other systems to check it does what you expect it to do.
5. You're good to go! Run the gcode and carefully watch the machine!
